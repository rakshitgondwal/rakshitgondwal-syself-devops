# Production-Grade Kubernetes Setup

## Infrastructure

1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**
   - We'll need to spin up at least 3 VMs to handle Kubernetes management. This ensures everything's running smoothly and stays available.
   - We should add enough VMs to actually run your apps. These do the heavy lifting and handle tasks from the control plane.

2. **Private Network**
   - An important step would be to use a private network to keep node communication secure and out of the public eye.
   - We can break the network into segments for different roles, like control plane, worker nodes, and extras like load balancers.

## Control Plane

1. **Kubernetes Components**
   - **kube-apiserver**: Manages API requests. Make sure it’s running on all control plane nodes for reliability.
   - **etcd**: This is where Kubernetes keeps its data. Use an odd number of nodes (3 or 5) to keep things safe and available.
   - **kube-controller-manager**: Handles various processes to keep the cluster in check.
   - **kube-scheduler**: Decides which pods go where based on available resources.

2. **High Availability**
   - We'll need to use an internal load balancer to spread out traffic to control plane nodes. This helps keep everything running smoothly.

## Networking

1. **Pod Networking**
   - First pick a plugin like Calico, Cilium, or Weave to handle network connections between your pods.

2. **Service Networking**
   - We'll need to Allocate IPs for services so they can be easily accessed within the cluster.

## Storage

1. **Container Storage Interface (CSI)**
   - Use a CSI driver that can dynamically manage storage and works with your setup.
   - We can then set up storage classes to manage storage needs for your applications.

## Security

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Using Role-Based Access Control we can manage who can do what in your cluster.
   - We can leverage Kubernetes’ built-in methods or integrate with other identity systems.

2. **Network Policies**
   - Next step can be to define rules to manage how pods and services talk to each other based on labels.

3. **Dynamic Policy Enforcement**
   - We could consider using Kyverno as a dynamic admission controller. It lets you enforce policies on what kind of resources can be allowed into your cluster, adding an extra layer of control and security.

### Supply Chain Security

Since Supply Chain Security is a important thing to consider and is often overlooked by many companies, some things that we can ensure to have a better software supply chain:

1. Container Signing and Image Signing.
2. Use 0 CVE Base Images for our Dockerfiles.
3. Make use of compliance initiaitves such as SLSA and S2C2F.
4. Sign our Helm Charts.
5. Have a tamper proof build solution.


## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Monitoring**
   - We can then set up Prometheus for gathering metrics and Grafana for visualizing them. Add alerting to keep tabs on the cluster’s health.

2. **Logging**
   - We can make use of tools like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki with Grafana for central logging.

## Testing

1. **Conformance Testing**
    - We can make use of tools like Hydrophone to have a lightweight conformance testing of our k8s environment.

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Etcd Backup**
   - We should regularly back up etcd data and store it safely.

2. **Application Data**
   - We need to have a backup plan for persistent volumes and app data. We should regularly test your recovery procedures.

## Infrastructure as Code

1. **Terraform** 
   - Tools like Terraform can help us to manage our whole infrastrucure as a form of a code.


## Deployment and Management

1. **Helm Charts**
   - We can use tools like Helm to deploy our application.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - We can later setup CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment process.
