# Production-Grade Kubernetes Setup

## Infrastructure

1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**
   - **Control Plane Nodes**: Spin up at least 3 VMs to handle Kubernetes management. This ensures everything's running smoothly and stays available.
   - **Worker Nodes**: Add enough VMs to actually run your apps. These do the heavy lifting and handle tasks from the control plane.

2. **Private Network**
   - **Secure Communication**: Use a private network to keep node communication secure and out of the public eye.
   - **Subnetting**: Break the network into segments for different roles, like control plane, worker nodes, and extras like load balancers.

## Control Plane

1. **Kubernetes Components**
   - **kube-apiserver**: Manages API requests. Make sure it’s running on all control plane nodes for reliability.
   - **etcd**: This is where Kubernetes keeps its data. Use an odd number of nodes (3 or 5) to keep things safe and available.
   - **kube-controller-manager**: Handles various processes to keep the cluster in check.
   - **kube-scheduler**: Decides which pods go where based on available resources.

2. **High Availability**
   - **Load Balancer**: Use an internal load balancer to spread out traffic to control plane nodes. This helps keep everything running smoothly.

## Networking

1. **Pod Networking**
   - **CNI Plugin**: Pick a plugin like Calico, Cilium, or Weave to handle network connections between your pods.

2. **Service Networking**
   - **Cluster IPs**: Allocate IPs for services so they can be easily accessed within the cluster.

## Storage

1. **Container Storage Interface (CSI)**
   - **Storage Provider**: Use a CSI driver that can dynamically manage storage and works with your setup.
   - **Persistent Volumes (PVs)**: Set up storage classes to manage storage needs for your applications.

## Security

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **RBAC**: Use Role-Based Access Control to manage who can do what in your cluster.
   - **Authentication**: Leverage Kubernetes’ built-in methods or integrate with other identity systems.

2. **Network Policies**
   - **Control Traffic**: Define rules to manage how pods and services talk to each other based on labels.

3. **Dynamic Policy Enforcement**
   - **Kyverno**: Consider using Kyverno as a dynamic admission controller. It lets you enforce policies on what kind of resources can be allowed into your cluster, adding an extra layer of control and security.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Monitoring**
   - **Prometheus and Grafana**: Set up Prometheus for gathering metrics and Grafana for visualizing them. Add alerting to keep tabs on the cluster’s health.

2. **Logging**
   - **ELK Stack or Loki**: Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki with Grafana for central logging. Make sure to collect logs from all nodes and components.

## Testing

1. **Conformance Testing**
    - We can make use of tools like Hydrophone to have a lightweight conformance testing of our k8s environment.

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Etcd Backup**
   - **Snapshotting**: Regularly back up etcd data and store it safely.

2. **Application Data**
   - **Backup Strategies**: Have a backup plan for persistent volumes and app data. Regularly test your recovery procedures.

## Deployment and Management

1. **Helm Charts**
   - **Application Deployment**: Use Helm charts to manage how your apps are deployed. You can create custom charts to fit your needs.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - **Pipelines**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment of your applications.
